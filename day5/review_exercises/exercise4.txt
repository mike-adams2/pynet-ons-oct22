Using your ArubaAPI class, connect to the Aruba Controller.

Using your get_request method query the controller for "object/sys_info"

From the returned data structure extract the following items: the software version
at the "global" level.

Also extract whether a "write memory" is required and the username that last saved
the config.

Print these fields out to standard output.
